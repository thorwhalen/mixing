"""Typed errors `mixing` raises — the home for exceptions a caller may want to catch.

Pure stdlib, imported by the lazy facade without pulling any backend, so a consumer
can ``from mixing import WindowTooWideForClip`` in a light module and still catch what
a heavy one raises.

The convention: an error class carries the MEASURED numbers as attributes, not only in
its message, so a caller can act on them (retry at the largest valid window, say) rather
than parse prose.

    """Base for every error `mixing` raises on its own behalf."""


class WindowTooWideForClip(MixingError, ValueError):
    """An explicit analysis window leaves a clip no second, independent look.

    Raised by :func:`mixing.audio.align_clips_to_reference` when the caller passes a
    ``window_s`` wider than :attr:`max_window_s` — the length above which the clip holds
    no second INDEPENDENT window, so the consensus vote has nothing to arbitrate and
    ``support`` comes back ``None``.

    Why an error and not a clamp or a silent single window: the caller asked for a
    windowed vote and would otherwise receive a single whole-clip correlation whose
    only signal is the ABSENCE of a support number — indistinguishable from a clip
    that is genuinely too short to support at any window (issue #43). Clamping would
    be worse still: an explicit ``window_s`` is the caller saying what a window means
    for their material, and silently measuring at a different one makes ``support``
    incomparable across a set for a reason nothing reports.

    It subclasses :class:`ValueError` because it is an argument that cannot be honored,
    so existing ``except ValueError`` handlers around alignment keep working.

    Attributes:
        clip_index: Position of the offending clip in the ``clips`` sequence, or
            ``None`` when the caller did not identify one.
        clip_duration_s: The clip's duration in seconds.
        window_s: The window that was asked for.
        hop_s: The hop in force — the caller's, or the one derived from ``window_s``.
            Reported because it is part of the grid that was asked for; it is NOT part
            of the bound, which does not depend on it (see
            :func:`~mixing.audio.audio_ops._max_supportable_window_s`).
        max_window_s: The largest window that still leaves this clip a second,
            independent look. The bound is inclusive, so for any clip long enough to be
            worth aligning a retry at exactly this window measures — which is what makes
            it worth reporting. A degenerate clip of a sample or two has no such window
            at all; the value is floored at one sample there and is a lower bound rather
            than a promise.
