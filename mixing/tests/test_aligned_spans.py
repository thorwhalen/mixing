"""``mixing.audio.aligned_spans`` — which PARTS of a clip align, and at what offset each.

``align_clips_to_reference`` answers "where does this clip sit?" with one number. That is
the right answer only for a clip that is one continuous take. A clip that was stopped and
restarted has no such number, and the single-offset model does not say so — it returns the
offset of whichever part correlated best and describes the rest of the clip wrongly, with a
confidence that looks fine. Measured below: a clip holding two takes of the same song
scores 0.494 on the single-offset path, which passes any sane trust gate.

The fixtures are small on purpose. Each window is an FFT cross-correlation against the
whole reference, so window count is the cost axis and these run in CI.

    """``consensus=False`` must be the OLD behaviour, measured against the old code.

    A new-vs-new comparison could not catch this: if the consensus path and the
    single-correlation path drifted together, both would move and the test would stay
    green. So the expected values were captured by running the pre-change checkout
    (ad8f056) and are pinned here as literals — including the two WRONG offsets that
    change motivated (-25.0 and 75.0), because a guardrail records what the code did,
    not what it should have done.

    The confidence is compared to 1e-9 rather than exactly: an FFT correlation can
    differ in its last bits across platforms and library versions, and a bit-exact pin
    would fail for reasons that have nothing to do with this function.
