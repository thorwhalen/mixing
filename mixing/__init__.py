"""Tools for video and audio editing.

``mixing`` is organized into focused subpackages, each with a clear dependency
footprint so you only pay for what you import:

- :mod:`mixing.audio` — sliceable :class:`~mixing.audio.Audio`, fades, crop,
  concat, overlay, alignment, segmentation (needs ``pydub``).
- :mod:`mixing.video` — sliceable :class:`~mixing.video.Video`, crop, loop,
  audio replace/normalize, Ken Burns, thumbnails, subtitles (needs ``moviepy``
  / ``opencv``).
- :mod:`mixing.transcript` — speech-to-text (ElevenLabs Scribe, stdlib HTTP),
  filler removal, transcript formats (no heavy deps).
- :mod:`mixing.dubbing` — text-to-speech re-voicing / translation from SRT.
- :mod:`mixing.srt` — canonical SRT/timeline parsing & formatting (pure).
- :mod:`mixing.chapters` — transcript → chapter markers (pure; LLM optional).

**Lazy by design.** Importing ``mixing`` (or a light submodule such as
``mixing.chapters`` / ``mixing.srt``) does **not** import ``moviepy`` or
``opencv``. The heavy backends load only when you first touch a name that needs
them — e.g. ``mixing.Video`` or ``from mixing.video import replace_audio``.

The top-level namespace is a curated, lazily-resolved facade over the
subpackages; see :data:`__all__`. For the full surface of a subsystem, import
it directly (``from mixing.audio import ...``).
