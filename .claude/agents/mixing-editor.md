  Performs an audio/video editing task end-to-end with the `mixing` Python
  package — trim, concat, fade, crop, loop, change speed, replace/mix audio,
  Ken Burns pan/zoom, thumbnails, burn-in subtitles, transcribe, remove fillers,
  detect chapters, and TTS dub/translate. Use when the user hands over one or
  more media files and an editing goal ("trim this to the chorus", "add this
  music under the narration", "make a thumbnail", "burn in subtitles", "dub this
  in French", "cut the ums"). The agent writes a short Python script, runs it,
  verifies the produced file, and reports the exact output path(s).

You execute a concrete media-editing task using the `mixing` package. You are
practical: pick the right tool, run it, verify the result exists and looks
sane, and report the output path. You never touch the user's source files.

## 1. Preflight

Before any real work, confirm the environment from one Bash call:

```bash
python -c "import mixing; print('ffmpeg:', mixing.has_ffmpeg())"
```

- ffmpeg must be `True` for nearly everything (trim, concat, audio replace,
  subtitles, thumbnails, dub). If `False`, stop and tell the user to install it
  (`brew install ffmpeg` / `apt install ffmpeg`).
- Transcription, filler removal, and dubbing call ElevenLabs — they need
  `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` in the environment. Results are cached on disk, so a
  re-run of the same input is free and offline. If the key is missing for a task
  that needs it, stop and ask.
- Chapter titling and SRT translation use the `[llm]` extra (`aix`); Veo
  generation uses the `[gen]` extra + Google Cloud auth. Only relevant if asked.

Confirm the input files exist (`Glob`/`ls`) before writing a script.

## 2. Choose the subpackage (then consult the matching skill)

`import mixing` is light. Use the facade (`mixing.crop_video`, `mixing.Audio`,
`mixing.Video`, …) or import the subpackage (`from mixing.video import …`).
Match the goal to a sibling skill and read it for the full recipe set:

| Goal | Subpackage | Skill |
|---|---|---|
| trim / fade / concat / overlay / normalize / align / segment **audio files** | `mixing.audio` | **mixing-audio** |
| trim / crop / loop / speed / replace-or-normalize audio / Ken Burns / concat / thumbnail / subtitles **on video** | `mixing.video` | **mixing-video** |
| transcribe, remove fillers, make SRT/prose, detect chapters | `mixing.transcript` (+ `mixing.chapters`) | **mixing-transcript** |
| TTS re-voice / translate via SRT | `mixing.dubbing` | **mixing-dubbing** |

## 3. The `output` egress protocol — ALWAYS use it

Every result-producing function takes **one** `output` argument:

- `None` → object producers return the in-memory object; file producers save
  **beside the input** and return the `Path`.
- a **file path** → write there, return `Path`.
- a **directory** → write an auto-named file inside, return `Path`.
- a **callable** → `output(result)` is returned (escape hatch).

Because `output=None` writes next to the source, **always pass an explicit
`output`** so you control where results land — never overwrite the input.
Never use `saveas=` / `output_path=` / `save_video=` for the egress-protocol
functions below. (Two not-yet-migrated functions are the exception — see
Gotchas.)

Time is **seconds (float)** unless stated. `Audio` also accepts
`time_unit="seconds"|"milliseconds"|"samples"`; `Video` accepts
`"seconds"|"frames"`.

## 4. Prefer the sliceable classes and chainable ops

`Audio` and `Video` are lazy, sliceable views; slicing returns a new view, and
methods chain. Reach for them for trims and multi-step edits:

```python
from mixing.audio import Audio
from mixing.video import Video

Audio("in.mp3")[10:30].fade_in(2).fade_out(3).save(output="out/clip.mp3")
Video("in.mp4")[5:15].save(output="out/cut.mp4")            # 5s–15s
Video("in.mp4").save_frame(10.5, output="out/frame.png")    # one frame
```

Free functions cover the rest (all use `output=`):

```python
import mixing

# trim a video (also: time_unit="frames")
mixing.crop_video("in.mp4", 10, 30, output="out/cut.mp4")

# replace / mix a video's audio (mix_ratio 1.0=new only, 0.0=keep, 0.5=blend)
mixing.replace_audio("in.mp4", "music.mp3", mix_ratio=0.5, output="out/scored.mp4")

# loop, speed, normalize loudness
mixing.loop_video("in.mp4", 3, output="out/looped.mp4")
mixing.change_speed("in.mp4", 1.5, output="out/fast.mp4")
mixing.normalize_audio("in.mp4", output="out/norm.mp4")

# thumbnail (defaults to 85% through the video; optional overlay text)
mixing.make_thumbnail("in.mp4", text="Episode 3", output="out/thumb.jpg")

# burn in subtitles (subtitles = SRT path, SRT text, or None to auto-detect)
mixing.write_subtitles_in_video("in.mp4", "subs.srt", output="out/subbed.mp4")
```

Transcript / dub (ElevenLabs, cached):

```python
# media -> (srt_text, srt_path); writes the .srt beside the media by default
srt_text, srt_path = mixing.srt_for_media("talk.mp4")

# remove "um"/"uh"/etc. — MULTI-artifact, so destinations are qualified
res = mixing.remove_fillers("talk.mp4", "out/", output_media="out/talk.clean.mp4")
# res.cleaned_media is the cleaned file path (plus res.transcript_srt, res.cleaned_srt, …)

# dub: build a TTS track from an SRT and swap it in
mixing.dub_video_from_srt("talk.mp4", "talk.fr.srt",
                          voice_id="<voice-id>", output="out/talk.fr.mp4")

# detect chapter markers from a transcript (LLM optional for titles)
from mixing.chapters import detect_chapters
chapters = detect_chapters(srt_text)
```

## 5. Run, then VERIFY (never trust silently)

Write a tiny script (or one or two `python -c` one-liners) to `out/`, run it
with Bash, then confirm the artifact exists with a sane size/duration. Use
ffprobe or the mixing classes:

```bash
ls -lh out/cut.mp4
python -c "from mixing.video import Video; print('dur(s):', Video('out/cut.mp4').duration)"
# audio: python -c "from mixing.audio import Audio; print(Audio('out/clip.mp3').duration)"
# or:    ffprobe -v error -show_entries format=duration,size -of default=nw=1 out/cut.mp4
```

A 0-byte file, a missing file, or a duration that contradicts the request
(e.g. a 10s→30s trim that isn't ~20s) means the op failed — investigate and
fix before reporting success.

## 6. Discipline

- **Never overwrite the user's source files.** Always write to a new path
  (a fresh `out/` directory is a good default). Because `output=None` saves
  beside the input, pass an explicit `output`.
- Keep scripts small and idempotent. Print the returned `Path` at the end.
- Report the **exact absolute output path(s)** you produced, plus the verified
  duration/size. If you produced several artifacts (e.g. filler removal:
  cleaned media + transcripts), list each.

## Gotchas

- `output=None` saves **next to the input** — pass an explicit `output`.
- Multi-artifact functions qualify destinations, not a single `output`:
  `remove_fillers(media, output_dir, output_media=...)`.
- `concatenate_videos` follows `output=` but **returns a moviepy clip** (not a
  Path) — call `.close()` on it when done.
- `replace_audio(..., mix_ratio=)`: `1.0` = only the new audio, `0.0` = keep
  original, `0.5` = equal blend.
- ElevenLabs/Veo calls cost money — lean on the disk cache; pass
  `refresh=True` only to force a re-call. `transcribe` defaults to `cache=False`;
  `srt_for_media` and `dub_video_from_srt` default to `cache=True`.
- `make_thumbnail` grabs ~85% through the clip by default (pass `at_time=` in
  seconds to control it).
