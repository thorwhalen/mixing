  Use for AUDIO editing with the `mixing` package: trim/crop a clip, fade in or
  fade out, join/concatenate clips (with optional crossfade), mix music under a
  voice or overlay one track on another, loop a short bed to a target length,
  duck a bed under dialogue, normalize loudness, convert to mono,
  resample, peek at raw samples, align two recordings of the same performance,
  or split a long recording (concert, DJ mix, radio show, podcast) into
  segments. Trigger on phrasings like "trim audio", "fade out the end", "join
  these audio clips", "add background music under the narration", "make it
  louder / normalize", "convert to mono", "align two recordings", "find the
  offset between these takes", "split a concert into songs", "separate speech
  from music", "loop this ambient clip to N seconds", "duck the music under
  the dialogue". For video audio (replace/normalize a video's track) use
  mixing-video; this skill is audio-file → audio-file.

# mixing-audio — edit audio files

`mixing.audio` gives you a sliceable `Audio` view plus free functions for
fades, crop, concat, overlay, normalize, alignment, and segmentation. Time is
**seconds (float)** by default. Needs ffmpeg + the `[audio]` extra
(`pip install mixing[audio]` → pydub/soundfile).

```python
import mixing

assert mixing.has_ffmpeg(), "install ffmpeg (brew install ffmpeg / apt install ffmpeg)"
from mixing.audio import Audio  # or facade: mixing.Audio
```

## The `output` protocol (applies to every writer here)

`output=None` → object producers return the in-memory `Audio`; `Audio.save`
and the `crop_*`/`save_audio_clip` file producers save **beside the input**.
A file path writes there; a directory auto-names; a callable is a sink. All
return a `Path` (or the sink's value). Never `saveas=`/`output_path=`.

## `Audio` — sliceable, chainable, in-memory

```python
a = Audio("song.mp3")  # time_unit defaults to "seconds"
a.duration
a.full_duration  # this view vs the whole source (s)
a.sample_rate
a.channels
a.sample_count  # 44100, 2, ...

a[10:30]  # 10s–30s → new Audio (lazy view, no copy)
a[-30:]  # last 30s
Audio("song.mp3", time_unit="samples")[0:44100]  # 1s @ 44.1kHz (kw-only)
Audio("song.mp3", time_unit="milliseconds")[500:1500]

# chain effects, then save (each returns a new Audio)
a[5:120].fade_in(2).fade_out(3).save(output="final.mp3")  # -> Path
a[10:30].save()  # output=None → beside input, returns Path
a1 = Audio("p1.mp3")
a2 = Audio("p2.mp3")
(a1 + a2).save(output="joined.mp3")  # __add__ concatenates

# transforms (pure pydub, no extra deps) — all return a new Audio:
a.normalize()  # peak-normalize; normalize(headroom=0.1)
a.to_mono()  # downmix to 1 channel
a.resample(16000)  # change sample rate (Hz)
a.overlay(other, position=5.0, gain_during_overlay=-6)  # mix `other` on top

# context manager (frees the in-memory buffer on exit):
with Audio("song.mp3") as a:
    dur = a.duration

# raw samples (collections.abc.Mapping[int, float], normalized to [-1, 1]):
s = a.samples
s[0]
s[-1]
s[1000:2000]  # negative index + slicing supported
```

`save(output=None, *, format=None, bitrate="192k", **export_kwargs)` —
`format` auto-detected from the extension when `None`.

## Free functions (file-or-object in, `output`-governed out)

```python
from mixing.audio import (
    crop_audio,
    fade_in,
    fade_out,
    concatenate_audio,
    overlay_audio,
    loop_audio,
    duck_audio,
    save_audio_clip,
    find_audio_offset,
)

# trim — first 3 positional, rest keyword-only:
crop_audio("song.mp3", 10, 30, output="clip.mp3")  # -> Path
crop_audio("song.mp3", 44100, 88200, time_unit="samples")  # output=None → beside input

# fades accept a path OR an Audio; output=None returns the Audio object:
fade_in("intro.mp3", 2.0, output="faded.mp3")  # -> Path
faded = fade_out("song.mp3", 3.0)  # -> Audio (not saved yet)

# join any number of clips; crossfade is in seconds:
concatenate_audio("intro.mp3", "main.mp3", "outro.mp3", output="full.mp3")
concatenate_audio("a.mp3", "b.mp3", crossfade=0.5)  # 500ms crossfade → Audio

# music under voice: mix_ratio is the PROMINENCE OF THE OVERLAY
#   1.0 = only overlay, 0.0 = only background, 0.5 = equal blend
overlay_audio("music.mp3", "voice.mp3", position=5.0, mix_ratio=0.35, output="mix.mp3")

# loop a short bed to a target length, crossfading every join (no click):
bed = loop_audio("room_tone.wav", 90.0)  # -> 90s Audio
loop_audio("waves.wav", 240.0, crossfade_s=1.0, output="bed.wav")  # -> Path

# duck a bed under dialogue (sidechain ducking, NOT a constant gain):
quiet_bed = duck_audio("bed.wav", "dialogue.wav", duck_db=-12)  # -> Audio

# extract a clip (audio_src=None pulls a path from the clipboard):
save_audio_clip("song.mp3", 10, 30, output="clip.mp3", format="mp3")

# align two recordings of the same take (cross-correlation) → offset in SECONDS:
offset = find_audio_offset("camera_audio.wav", "studio.mp3")  # float, sample_rate=16000
# positive => query (studio) starts `offset`s into the reference (camera)

# ...and when the clip is NOT one continuous take, ask which PARTS align:
from mixing.audio import aligned_spans

for sp in aligned_spans("song.mp3", "phone_recording.mp4"):
    sp.clip_start_s, sp.clip_end_s  # in the CLIP's timeline
    sp.offset_s, sp.confidence  # reference_time = clip_time + offset_s
    sp.support  # how much of the span's evidence reaches that offset — see below
    sp.margin  # ...and how far that is AHEAD of the runner-up offset — see below
    sp.reference_span  # the same extent on the SONG timeline
```

### One offset, or several?

`find_audio_offset` / `align_clips_to_reference` answer **"where does this clip sit?"**
with a single number. That is the right answer only for one continuous take. A recording
that was **stopped and restarted** has no such number — and the single-offset model does
not say so, it returns the offset of whichever part correlated best and describes the rest
of the clip wrongly, *at a confidence that clears any gate*. Measured on a clip holding two
takes of the same song: `0.494`.

`aligned_spans` is the windowed answer. A clip that IS one take returns exactly one span,
so it is a safe replacement rather than a different tool.

**Boundary resolution is `window_s` (default 20 s), and no better.** A window is evidence
that its whole extent aligns; a boundary falling inside one degrades that window rather
than locating itself within it. Ample for telling two takes apart, **not enough to cut
on**. Shrink `window_s` to buy precision — cost is linear in the window count.

### Repetitive music: gate on `support`, not on `confidence` alone

Both `aligned_spans` and `align_clips_to_reference` decide the offset by **consensus**
across analysis windows rather than by one argmax, because on a reference that repeats
verbatim the correlation's top two peaks are near-tied (0.987–0.993 second-to-first on
real music) and the argmax is close to a coin flip. Before the consensus pass a
verse/chorus reference split one continuous take into 4 spans, three of them at wrong
offsets — the worst scoring *higher* than the correct one.

So read the two numbers as different questions:

- **`confidence`** — how well the clip matches *where this answer puts it*. On repetitive
  material it stays high, and it should: the match really is that good.
- **`support`** (0–1, or `None`) — how much of the windows' own evidence reaches that
  offset. A window whose independent argmax landed there counts a full 1.0; a window that
  only put it on its **ballot** — could not separate it from its own answer — counts half,
  scaled by how close it scored; a window that never considered it counts nothing. 1.0 on
  material with no repeats; ~0.72 on verse/chorus; ~0.56 on an exactly tiling reference,
  where every offset is equally true and no confidence would ever say so. It also drops
  when only *part* of the clip is the reference at all (measured 0.545 on a
  half-song/half-noise clip), which is what localises where a clip stops matching.
- **`margin`** (a difference of two `support` tallies, or `None`) — how far that evidence
  sits **ahead of the best OTHER offset's**. Support cannot see a runner-up; this is the
  field that can. ~0.99 with no repeats; ~0.33 on verse/chorus; ~0.00 on an exactly tiling
  reference, where nine offsets are equally true.

High confidence with low support means *"it fits here beautifully — and it would fit
elsewhere too."*

**`support > 0.5` means at least one independent window found the offset unaided.** That
is the boundary the half-weight buys: ballot mentions alone can never carry the tally past
0.5, so the top half of the range is reserved for unaided agreement — which is exactly
what the whole number used to mean before it was graded. Gate above 0.5 if that is the
question you are asking; gate lower if "the clip's evidence points here" is enough.

**If you carried a threshold over from 0.0.48 or earlier, move it — do not reuse the
number.** Every value in `(0, 0.5]` is now reachable with *zero* windows having found the
offset unaided, so a gate that used to mean "a quarter of the windows located this
themselves" now means "some of the clip's evidence mentions it". A gate at 0.25 is inside
that band. If your threshold was chosen to mean unaided agreement, its equivalent on this
scale is **`> 0.5`**, not `> 0.25`.

That is not a cosmetic re-tune: measured at the default window, an **exactly tiling**
reference (the offset is a free choice among nine) lands just *below* 0.5 and a reference
that is **one half twice** lands just *above* it. A gate at 0.5 separates those two; a
gate at 0.25 passes both.

**What is unchanged by the grading is an undisputed argmax, not a long clip.** A 60 s clip
at the default 20 s window is bit-identical on a non-repeating reference — every window
got there on its own, so there is nothing to add. The same clip against a reference that
repeats moves from 0.00 to about 0.50, because no window resolves the repeat alone and all
of them have the true offset on their ballots. Length was never what made the old number
safe.

**It was a bare argmax headcount until 0.0.49** (issue #45), and the same fixtures read
0.44 / 0.11 under the old definition. The headcount broke on short clips: an argmax is a
real opinion at a 20 s window and close to a coin flip at the ~4 s window a 12 s clip is
fitted to, so the statistic got *less* confident exactly as fitting the window made the
estimator *more* reliable. Measured on real cross-device material, 21 alignments that were
**all correct** scored 0.00–1.00 with six at 0.00, and a gate at 0.25 refused about half
of them. Where the argmax was already decisive — a long clip at the default 20 s window —
the graded tally reports exactly what the headcount did.

**`align_clips_to_reference` fits the window to each clip.** Its `window_s`/`hop_s` default
to `None`, which means `min(20 s, clip_duration / 3)` with a floor of 3 s (300 onset-envelope
frames) and a hop of half whatever window comes out. A clip holding three default windows or
more is measured at 20 s exactly, so long clips are untouched; a short clip that used to be
one window — no vote, `support=None`, and whatever a single correlation said — now gets
several. Measured on real cross-device material: a 10 s clip against a 250 s reference came
back 102 s from the truth at confidence 0.834 as one window, and was right at every window
from 3 s to 6 s. **The threshold is independent LOOKS, not one window**: support needs two
windows separated by half a window, so the default grid needed about `window_s + hop_s` =
30 s before a clip had a second opinion — 22, 24 and 26 s clips against a 90 s reference all
read `None`, and the 22 s one was 64 s wrong at confidence 0.279 where `window_s=10` was
right to 3 ms. Pass a number to fix the window yourself; an explicit value is never
overridden.

**Read `ClipAlignment.window_s` whenever you gate on `support`.** It reports the window that
clip's vote was actually held at — the scale its `support` is on — and it is `None` exactly
when `support` is. Since the window is fitted per clip, a fixed threshold across clips of
different lengths compares numbers that answer different questions: measured on real
cross-device material, **21 alignments that were all correct reported the pre-0.0.49
argmax headcount from 0.00 to 1.00**, largely by clip length, because a 4 s window on a
12 s clip is a weaker opinion than a 20 s window on a 60 s one. Grading the tally softens
that spread but does not remove it. Scale your threshold to `window_s`, or pass an explicit
`window_s` to put every clip on one scale. `aligned_spans` is NOT adapted — there `window_s` is boundary resolution, which
is the caller's to choose.

**Reading `window_s` is necessary and, since 0.0.49, no longer sufficient.** A rule of the
form *"below the default window, treat the value as unmeasured"* was a complete defence
while `support` was an argmax headcount, because the window was the only axis that moved
it. Not any more: what a repeating reference does to the tally, it does at `window_s=20`
too — a 60 s clip there goes from 0.00 to about 0.50 on a bed that tiles. `window_s` still
tells you how strong each opinion was; nothing puts the number back on the scale a
pre-0.0.49 threshold was calibrated against. **Re-measure such a threshold against this
statistic; do not re-point it at it.**

**If you have a window guard, DELETE it — do not keep it alongside a new threshold.** A
rule that declines to trust `support` below the default window has to send those clips
somewhere, and the only thing left is `confidence`. That fallback is weaker than the
statistic the guard was protecting against. Measured on six pure-noise clips at a fitted
6.67 s window: confidences of 0.017–0.173 cleared a consumer's floor of 0.1 for **four of
the six**, while graded `support > 0.5` refused all six. Grading is what makes `support`
usable at a fitted window in the first place, so gate on it directly.

**`support is None` means NOT MEASURED — do not read it as 1.0.** You get it with
`consensus=False`, for a clip shorter than one window *at the window in force*, and when
the windows overlap by more than half (two windows sharing 95% of their samples are one
look read twice, not two opinions). One window cannot disagree with itself, and a unanimous
vote of one would vouch for an offset nothing corroborated. Measured, both at a pinned
`window_s=20`: a 15 s clip truly at offset 30 against a two-identical-halves reference comes
back at offset 75.0 with confidence 0.979 — and at the fitted default it comes back at 30.0,
which is the point of fitting it; and on real footage a 10 s clip at `window_s=9.5, hop_s=0.5`
had its two near-identical windows agree on an offset 102 s wrong. A `support` of 1.0 in
either case carries the wrong answer through any gate. When it is `None`, fall back to
`confidence` and know you are trusting a single opinion.

One consequence worth knowing: the tail window that covers a clip whose length is not a
whole number of hops usually starts less than half a window after its neighbour, so it is
excluded from the tally and the denominator loses one. Measured, that moved one real
clip's support from 0.45 to 0.50 — offsets are unaffected either way.

**`support` is relative to `window_s` — if you change the window, revisit your
threshold.** A shorter window is a weaker opinion, so fewer of them agree. Measured on the
same three correct cross-device alignments, on the pre-0.0.49 headcount: 0.45 / 0.64 / 0.73
at `window_s=20`, and 0.19 / 0.16 / 0.23 at `window_s=5`. It is deliberately not
normalised, so compare clips at
the same window and re-tune any gate you move the window under. With the fitted default,
clips of different lengths are NOT at the same window — pass an explicit `window_s` when you
rank clips by support.

### `support` is a floor; `margin` is a separator — gate on both

`support` answers *"how much of the clip's own evidence reaches this offset"*. It cannot
answer *"and how much reaches somewhere else instead?"* — and on repetitive material that
second question is the one that decides whether the answer is trustworthy. `margin`
(0.0.51, issue #47) answers it: the same graded tally, read at the best offset **outside
`offset_tolerance_s`** of the answer, subtracted. Same scale as `support`, same units,
same `None` rule.

Why a third number rather than a better threshold on the second: three scalars have now
been measured *not* to separate correct from wrong on real cross-device material.
`confidence` — the wrong offset's peak scored 0.987–0.993 of the right one's, sometimes
higher. `support` — an ambiguous tiling lands mid-scale *by construction*, because every
alias genuinely is reached by the same evidence. The window guard — deleted in 0.0.50,
having been measured not to separate them either. A fraction cannot see a runner-up.

Read the pair as a 2×2:

| | wide margin | margin ≈ 0 |
|---|---|---|
| **high support** | the evidence points here and nowhere else | it fits here *and fits somewhere else exactly as well* — an exact tiling |
| **low support** | thin evidence, undisputed — a short clip on a repeating bed. **A support-only gate refuses this and should not** | nothing is known |

Measured on synthetic material at `window_s=10`: no repetition `support 1.00 / margin
0.99`; verse/chorus `0.72 / 0.33`; exactly tiling `0.50 / -0.00`. And at the fitted
window, a **correct** 16 s clip on a bed that tiles every 2 s: `0.50 / +0.12`. That last
pair is the point — the ambiguous tiling and the correct short clip are
**indistinguishable on support** and opposite on margin.

**Measured on real cross-device material, `margin` is not an addition to a `support`
gate — it is a better gate.** 24 correct alignments against 6 pure-noise clips:
`support > 0.5` (the gate this skill recommended above) passed **18/24** and refused
**0/6**; `support > 0.5 and margin > 0` passed the same 18/24, so the conjunction added
nothing; and **`margin > 0` alone passed 24/24 and still refused 0/6**, recovering every
correct short clip the support floor was turning away. Five of the six noise clips came
back **negative** (-0.167 to -0.317) and no correct alignment did — read a negative
margin as a refusal, not just as a failure to vouch.

**Keep a floor under it anyway.** The sixth noise clip scored exactly `+0.000` — refused
by an exact tie, which a different draw does not guarantee — and two correct alignments
passed at `+0.014` and `+0.029` on a support of 0.34–0.35, the "thin evidence,
undisputed" row with nothing beneath it. `support > 0.25 and margin > 0` scored the same
24/6 while giving five of the six noise clips a second, independent reason to fail.
Thirty cases is encouraging and is not proof — so if you gate on one number, gate on
`margin`; if you gate on two, put a low support floor under it rather than the old 0.5.

**A wide margin is not a claim of sub-tolerance precision.** Offsets closer together
than `offset_tolerance_s` are one hypothesis by construction, so a candidate that near is
the answer and never subtracts: at the default tolerance a rival 0.20 s away leaves the
margin at 1.000, and the same rival at 0.30 s takes it to 0.505. Margin says nothing else
has an equal claim *at a different offset*; how sharply the offset itself is located is
`offset_tolerance_s`, which is yours to set.

**It can be slightly negative**, and is not clamped. The offset is chosen by the vote's
headcount over every window; the tally is graded and read over the independent windows
only, so the two need not rank identically. A negative margin says the tally actually
prefers somewhere else — the strongest *do not trust this* the object carries.

**`margin is None` exactly where `support is None`**, for the same reason: one independent
look has no runner-up to be ahead of, and a number invented there would vouch. It is
relative to `window_s` for the same reason `support` is — same tally, same scale.

`near_tie_ratio=0.0` disables the vote and restores the old per-window argmax;
`align_clips_to_reference(..., consensus=False)` restores its single whole-clip
correlation exactly (cheaper: one correlation instead of one per window).

### Cross-device recordings: `feature=` picks the offset, not just the score

`align_clips_to_reference` and `aligned_spans` default to `feature='envelope'`, and under
consensus (the default) that choice **moves the offset**. Two microphones in a room are not
sample-correlated even when the alignment is exact, so a raw-waveform correlation can put
its best peak somewhere the clip never was — measured on real multi-device footage at 15 s
from the truth, and *at `support=1.00`*, because the bias is the same in every window and a
vote ratifies what it cannot vary. The onset envelope reads WHEN energy arrives, which two
devices share, so it nominates the lag the waveform never offers; each nomination is then
scored by the better of the two views, so material with no onsets (a smooth tone, an export
against its own master) still lands on the waveform's answer.

Pass `feature='waveform'` when the clip comes from the SAME source as the reference.
`find_audio_offset` / `find_audio_offset_detailed` are single-shot — no windows, no vote —
so there `feature=` still changes only the confidence.

## Segmentation — split a long recording into pieces

```python
from mixing.audio import find_segments, extract_segments, Segment

segs = find_segments("concert.wav", strategy="self_similarity")  # -> list[Segment]
for s in segs:
    s.start, s.end, s.duration, s.label, s.score  # all seconds; label/score optional
    s.as_start_end()  # (start, end)
    s.as_offset_duration()  # (start, duration)

# discover AND export in one call (output is a DIRECTORY, one file per segment):
paths = extract_segments(
    "concert.wav", strategy="self_similarity", output="songs/", format="mp3"
)  # -> list[Path]
# or pass timestamps you already have ((start, end) tuples or Segments):
extract_segments("mix.mp3", segments=[(0, 245), (247, 445)], output="tracks/")
```

Strategies (pick by regime; pass tuning kwargs straight through to `find_segments`):

| `strategy=` | When | Key kwargs |
|---|---|---|
| `"silence"` (default) | clean gaps (DJ mix, audiobook) | `silence_thresh_db=-40`, `min_silence_len=1.0` |
| `"energy_novelty"` | fade-outs / quiet moments, no true silence | `valley_threshold_factor=0.5`, `min_peak_distance_seconds=30` |
| `"self_similarity"` | concert/live: spectral content changes, level steady | `kernel_seconds=12.0`, `min_peak_distance_seconds=30` |
| `"speech_music"` | radio/podcast: tag spoken vs musical regions | `low_energy_threshold=0.5`, `min_segment_duration=3.0` |

`find_segments(..., strategy=, min_segment_duration=, max_segment_duration=,
merge_gap=, pad_start=, pad_end=, **strategy_kwargs)`. You can also pass your
own `(AudioSegment, **kwargs) -> list[Segment]` callable as `strategy`. The
`segment_by_silence/energy/self_similarity/speech_music` functions are exported
too if you want to call one directly on a pydub `AudioSegment`.

## Common recipes

```python
# Trim, normalize, fade, save:
Audio("raw.wav")[2:65].normalize().fade_in(1).fade_out(2).save(output="clean.mp3")

# 16kHz mono for an STT/ML pipeline:
Audio("voice.mp3").to_mono().resample(16000).save(output="voice_16k.wav")

# Duck background music under narration (music at ~30% under the voice):
overlay_audio(
    "music.mp3", "narration.mp3", position=0.0, mix_ratio=0.3, output="podcast.mp3"
)

# Ambient bed under a dialogue track: loop to length, duck, mix at 25%:
base = Audio("dialogue.wav")
bed = duck_audio(loop_audio("room_tone.wav", base.duration), base)
overlay_audio(base, bed, mix_ratio=0.25, output="with_room_tone.wav")
# (one call over a file: mixing.video.overlay_ambient_bed — works on video too)

# Align a clean studio take to a camera recording, then crop the camera to match:
off = find_audio_offset("camera.wav", "studio.mp3")
crop_audio("camera.wav", off, off + Audio("studio.mp3").duration, output="aligned.wav")

# Split a radio show into speech vs music regions and save each:
extract_segments("show.mp3", strategy="speech_music", output="parts/")
```

## Gotchas

- `Audio(..., time_unit=...)` is **keyword-only**. Slicing uses that unit;
  `step` in a slice (`a[::2]`) is rejected.
- Slicing with a single index (`a[100]`) returns a 1-sample-long `Audio`, not a
  number. For raw values use `a.samples[100]`.
- `output=None` for `Audio.save`/`crop_audio`/`save_audio_clip` writes **next to
  the input** (auto-named) — pass an explicit `output` to control location.
- `overlay_audio`'s `mix_ratio` is the overlay's prominence (1.0 = only overlay).
  Don't confuse it with `Audio.overlay`'s `gain_during_overlay` (a dB number).
- `loop_audio`'s `crossfade_s` is **clamped to half the source duration** —
  each join must still advance the timeline. The tail is cut wherever the target
  lands (mid-loop is normal) and no fade-out is applied; chain `fade_out` if the
  bed ends exposed.
- `duck_audio` is a level-detector ducker, **not** a compressor and **not** a
  VAD: fixed depth (`duck_db`, no ratio/knee), no lookahead, and *any* loud
  sidechain content (music, a slam) ducks the bed exactly like speech would.
  Raise `threshold_db` if room noise is triggering it. The result always has the
  **bed's** duration; a shorter sidechain leaves the tail un-ducked.
- `find_audio_offset` returns **seconds** (positive = query starts inside the
  reference); the two recordings need only a shared correlated component.
- `aligned_spans` merges neighbours that AGREE on the offset across a gap of up to
  one window, and that is not tidying: a dozen seconds of silence mid-take collapses
  the windows inside it to a confidence of exactly 0, so one continuous recording
  would otherwise come back as two spans carrying the **same** offset — a
  stop/restart that never happened. A stop and a restart cannot resume in sync, so
  agreement across a short gap is positive evidence of continuity. The gap bound is
  what keeps it honest: past it, correlation cannot tell "quiet" from "different
  material", and both spans are reported rather than one claiming a range nothing
  measured. Widen with `merge_gap_s` if your material warrants it.
- `extract_segments(output=...)` treats `output` as a **directory** (it emits
  many files), unlike the single-file writers. Default dir is the source's
  parent (or cwd for non-path input).
- Segmentation is a tuned toolbox, not magic — expect to adjust the per-strategy
  kwargs (thresholds, distances) for your material.
```
